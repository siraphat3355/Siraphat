# Hello, My name is Siraphat. 

  Currently, I'm a Data Science and Artificial Intelligence student on Master's degree at Asian Institute of Technology.
  My background knowledge was about Electrical Engineering. My interested fields are about investment, AI model and psychology.
  
  However, I put some codes which I have to learn and implement it into my Github. I think It would be better that you can get something from my coding instead I just keep it in my Google Drive.
  
  If all of you have some dubts in my code. Please do not hesitate to ask me. Maybe we can exchange the knowledge and make relationship.
  
  Best
  Siraphat B.
