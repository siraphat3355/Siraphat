\chapter{EXPECTED OUTCOMES}
\label{ch:results}
\paragraph{}
This chapter describes the expected results of this study based on objectives. The expected results are: 

\textbf{For the object 1:} Design and build filter, amplifier and embedded system.
\begin{itemize}
\item The analog circuit and embedded system which can detect vibrational signal of human activity on the concrete floor
\end{itemize}


\textbf{For the object 2:}  Collect normally human activities.
\begin{itemize}
\item The csv file that contains raw sequential data of each activity, name of activity and subject.
\end{itemize}


\textbf{For the object 3:} Build anomaly detection model for detecting anomaly event as fall


\textbf{For the object 4:} Deploy this system in the dining room
\begin{itemize}
\item Can send alert message to the registered user though Line application when fall occur immediately.
\end{itemize}
