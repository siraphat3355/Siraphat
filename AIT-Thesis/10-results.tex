\chapter{PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS}
\label{ch:results}


\section{Experimental Setup}
\paragraph{}
To collect the raw data, experiments are performed in the living room of my house in Bangkok, Thailand, which was built from reinforced concrete with tile, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:home}. The system can detect vibration in a range around 3 meters, and this room has dimension 3.5 $\times$ 3.5 $\text{m}^2$. The hardware should be installed near the corner in order to be as suitable for the application as possible.

\section{Ordinary Activiting}
\paragraph{}
There are several activities that occur normally during daily life. I focus on typical activities such as walking, sitting, standing and lying down, as shown in Table \ref{tab:number_action}. Under COVID-19, I cannot invite outside volunteers to come indoor for data collection. However, if the COVID situation in Thailand improves, I will invite approximate 3-5 friends to participate in ordinary activities. In the meantime, I plan to collect activities of four subjects, my father, my mother, my older brother, and me. Details of them are shown in Table \ref{tab:participants}.

\section{Deployment}
\paragraph{}
The desirable system should be plug \& play. Therefore, every component such as seismic sensor, embedded system and Raspberry Pi must be integrated into a small box requiring only a power adapter, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:application}. When anomaly activities occur, an alert message should be sent via the LINE application to me. I plan to train on data from the living room and test on the dining room in my house, as shown in \ref{fig:dining}.
